# ScrobblerBrainz
A MusicBee plug-in to scrobble tracks to ListenBrainz.

# Restrictions
1. Not very well tested, I just created the first version.
1. Breaks when there are issues on ListenBrainz side.
1. No MBIDs in the scrobble. MusicBee doesn't expose them in the API.
1. No offline scrobbling. All scrobbles are lost when there's no internet.
1. No playcount sync.
1. No "now listening".
1. Or any other feature the last.fm scrobbler has.
