# ScrobblerBrainz
A MusicBee plug-in to scrobble tracks to ListenBrainz.

# Restrictions
1. ~~Unless there are issues listed in pt. 4~~ For me it works better than the last.fm scrobbler.
1. No MBIDs in the scrobble. MusicBee doesn't expose them in the API.
1. ~~No offline scrobbling. All scrobbles are lost when there's no internet or ListenBrainz is having trouble.~~
1. No playcount sync.
1. No "now listening".
1. Or any other feature the last.fm scrobbler has.
